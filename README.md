# Need for DSA ðŸŽ¯

[opendevs](https://opendevs.in/) is starting a **Need for DSA ðŸŽ¯** series on its [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/XRhdQkMkQp) where we would be conducting DSA sessions, starting from scratch and making you a pro in problem-solving.

We will be taking a class on Saturdays and sharing problems and assignments related to that topic in the following week so that you get plenty of time to fully grasp and practice the concepts. You'll be learning along with your peers, competing in virtual contests, and helping each other along the way.

# Pre-requisites

1. Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/XRhdQkMkQp). Lecture will be held there.

# Who this course is for?

This couse is meant for *doers* and people who believe in *practice makes perfect*. This not NOT a paid course, there will be no spoon-feeding. This is a community-driven course. We'll take the session, share resources and practice problems but you and *only* you will have to act and ask for help. ðŸ™‚

If you're already familiar with DSA, there will be some challenging problems as well that you can solve and share your solutions. Feel free to volunteer as well.

# Voluteering

If you're interested in volunteering as a mentor for the course, just let the admins know on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/XRhdQkMkQp).

As a volunteer, you may take one or more of the following responsibilities:
- Take a few sessions on DSA topics/concepts of your choice
- Share challenging DSA problems and editorial solutions as well
- Guide the students
- and anything that you think could benefit the community ðŸ™‚

# Need for DSA ðŸŽ¯

[opendevs](https://opendevs.in/) is starting a **Need for DSA ðŸŽ¯** series on its [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/XRhdQkMkQp) where we would be conducting DSA sessions, starting from scratch and making you a pro in problem-solving.

We will be taking a class every Saturday and sharing problems and assignments related to that topic in the following week so that you get plenty of time to fully grasp and practice the concepts. You'll be learning along with your peers, competing in virtual contests, and helping each other along the way.

# Pre-requisites

1. Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/XRhdQkMkQp). Lecture will be held there.
